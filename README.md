# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I take into consideration that I may not be the only one reading my code, so I try to write and develop my code in a way that is readable to others and annotate often and well. I want someone who has never worked on the project I am working on to be able to read my annotated comments and my README file and have a basic understanding of what is going on. I also take into consideration that this work may be updated in the future by myself or someone else, so I try to write and develop my code in a way that can be adapted to other situations.

#How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I try to approach situations or problems in a logical fashion. Once I have an understanding of the situation, I try to break down the problem into bite-size portions that are easier to handle. Once this is done, I can start tackling the situation piece by piece, working towards a solution.

#What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists design, develop, and analyze software and hardware that is used to solve problems in all kinds of industries. This is important, as society as we know it has integrated technology into almost every aspect of our day to day lives and business. As technology continues to grow daily, we as computer scientists must always keep up with the growing technology to ensure companies and users have the best software and hardware available, while keeping their privacy and safety our top priority.
